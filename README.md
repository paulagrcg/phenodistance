# Phenotypic distance analysis on RNA12 GP map


## **functions** folder
- basefunctions.py: all the basic functions to work with the GP map.
- structurefunctions.py: functions to calculate structural quantities (robustness, evolvability) in phenotypic distance framework.
## plots and main
code for plots and phenotypic distance quantities on the RNA12 GP map
## RNA20 
sampled_sequences are the filtered and sampled fRNA sequneces that we use for site-scanning

The data plotted in Fig 4 correlations is in RNA20_structures_h_vs_rho_significant.csv
